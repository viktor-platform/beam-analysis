This app can be used to perform 2D structural beam calculations. With this app you can:
1. Parametrically define the geometry, from a simple beam to a complex truss structure
2. Apply supports, point loads and distributed loads
3. Select a steel profile from a standard library (IPE, HEA, HEB)
4. Calculate and visualize resulting reaction forces, shear forces, bending moments and displacements
5. Optimize the required steel profile (based on bending moment)
